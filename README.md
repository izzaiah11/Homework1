# Code Refactor Starter Code

# Description 
For this project we were given starter code for a marketing agencies home web page. What I was tasked with doing is modifying the starter code to read semantically, add attributes where needed & to clean up the HTML and CSS. So that the agencies pages follows accessibility standards so that their site is optimized for search engines. 

# Changes made 
Changing the title of the page from 'website' to 'Horiseon' to accurately reflect the companies name. 

Changing the div class header to nav class header.
